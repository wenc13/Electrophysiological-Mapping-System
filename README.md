# Electrophysiological Mapping System
It is the implementation of three-dimensional electrophysiological mapping system.

Arrhythmia is a common cardiovascular disease in clinical practice. With the development of cardiac electrophysiology, radiofrequency catheter ablation has become the preferred method for treating arrhythmia. Compared to traditional drug therapy and pacemaker therapy, radiofrequency catheter ablation has a series of advantages, including quick effectiveness, minimal side effects, and low recurrence rates. Radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures require treating the cardiac lesions under the guidance of a three-dimensional electrophysiological mapping system. In this repository, the system is developed based on the Qt application framework, with three-dimensional graphics rendering and deformation achieved through OpenGL.

## Installation:
